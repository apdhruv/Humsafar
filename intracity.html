The family is one of the most illustrious families in Deccan history, five of them having been prime-ministers in the erstwhile Nizam rule of Hyderabad-Deccan. Nawab Mir Yousuf Ali Khan, popularly known as Salar Jung III was appointed prime minister by Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Nizam VII in 1912. Salar Jung III relinquished the post of dewan or Prime Minister in November 1914 and devoted his life in enriching his treasures of art and literature.
The news of his passionate love for art had spread far and wide and his ancestral palace, the Dewan Deodi was forever thronged with sellers of wares from all corners of the world. He also had agents abroad who sent him catalogues and lists from well-known antique dealers. He did not limit his purchases only to these sources but also made purchases personally during his tours abroad to Europe and the Middle Eastern countries.

Not only was he a great collector of antiques, art and rare manuscripts he also patronized poets, writers and artists, encouraging literary and cultural activities. He was responsible for the publication of many books on his own family members.
This went on for forty years till he passed away on 2nd March 1949., the entire collection was left behind without an inheritor. It was the family members of the late Nawab who got together to gift the fabulous collection to the nation as there could not have been a better proposal.
